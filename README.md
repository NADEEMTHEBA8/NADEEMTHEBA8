Greetings! 

I'm Nadeem, a recent MSc. graduate in Data Science & Analytics, passionate about harnessing the power of data to drive business success. With a focus on applied research, I'm eager to apply my expertise in Python, JavaScript, SQL, PowerBI, and Tableau to uncover actionable insights. I have a keen interest in sports data analytics and enjoy delving into data to uncover valuable insights. 

Outside of work, I enjoy watching cricket, going for leisurely walks, and staying updated with podcasts. Let's connect and discuss the endless possibilities of data-driven decision-making!
